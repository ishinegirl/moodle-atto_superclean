Superclean for Atto

WHAT IS IT
=============
Google Chrome adds a whole lot of junk inside span tags when you do a copy and paste in the text editor.
The source code view quickly becomes unusable. Its more a Chrome problem than a Moodle one, they say. 

Super clean removes ALL span tags from the html editor. Leaving just the text they surrounded. 
Its like clearing a forest with a bomb. So be careful.

QUICK INSTALL
=============
Put this entire directory at:

PATHTOMOODLE/lib/editors/atto/plugins/superclean

Visit your site notifications page to install the new plugins.

Add the "superclean" plugin to the Atto toolbar settings from site admin -> plugins -> text editors -> atto

This will add a # mark to the toolbar in that position.

Click the # mark to do a superclean.
